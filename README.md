Filtering is not working properly. Some other things that I didn't have time for: ErrorHandler, making an app responsive on all type of devices, some small fixes and bugs.

AngularMaterial, Bootstrap, Express API, CLI, CDK, FONT AWESOME.

Express api running on port 3000, and Angular app on 4200. Paths from angular app eg. /api/getCollection will be transformed to /getCollection.
